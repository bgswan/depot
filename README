Demo App From ScotRUG Presentation
==================================

This app has the following branches:

  * master: The depot app from the Pragmatic Programmers 'Agile Web Development with Rails'
  * with_rspec: The tests converted to use rspec
  * fast_tests: Extraction of methods into lib
  * explicit_require: Change the spec_helper to explicitly require active_record and not load all of Rails
  * minitest: Explicitly require active_record in the minitest tests
  
Also included is an experiment in using the terminal as the presentation tool. The shell script /presentation uses the figlet tool to display a banner message on the console and creates a new shell at the point in the presentation when a demo is required.

To install figlet on Mac OS X:
  
  brew install figlet
